## Some rules to abide by

- Use tags to organize your notes and make it easier to find specific notes later on. For example, you might use tags to label notes by project or goal, or to indicate the type of information contained in each note.
- Tags are always plural
- Use only a  few designated amount of tags, they should be clearly defined and no tag should overlap with another in terms of what they mean to preserve ontology of the wiki.
- Create a separate note for each area of focus and use backlinks to connect the notes together. This will help you see the connections between different notes and make it easier to navigate between them. Perhaps tag an area of focus as an `#areas`.

## PARA

- **Projects**: This folder will contain notes related to specific projects you are working on. For example, if you are working on a book, you might have a folder called "Book Project" where you store all of your notes and ideas related to the book.
- **Areas**: This folder will contain notes related to broad areas of your life or work. For example, you might have an "Fitness" folder where you store all of your notes and ideas related to staying healthy and fit.
- **Resources**: This folder will contain notes that serve as references or resources for other notes in your second brain. For example, you might have a folder called "Research" where you store articles, books, and other resources that you want to use as references for your own ideas and projects.
- **Archives**: This folder will contain notes that are no longer actively used but you want to keep for reference. For example, you might have an "Ideas" folder where you store ideas that you came up with but are no longer working on.

> [!note]
> When creating a new note, think about how it fits into the overall structure of your second brain. For example, if you have a note about a new workout routine that you want to try, you might store it in the "Fitness" folder in the "Areas" section of your second brain.


## Why PARA

1.  P: Project-Based: Organize your information around specific projects or goals. This can help you focus your efforts and see the big picture.
2.  A: Areas: Divide your projects into smaller areas of focus. This can help you break down complex tasks into manageable chunks and make progress on each part of a project.
3.  R: Resources: Collect and organize the resources you need to complete your projects. This can include things like notes, documents, links, and other materials.
4.  A: Actions: Identify the specific actions you need to take to complete each project and track your progress. This can help you stay on track and make sure that you are making progress on your projects.
